# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Joaquin"
age = 17
favorite_color = "Purple"
favorite_number = 24

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print("Length of name:", len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My name is", (first_name), "and my favorite color is", (favorite_color))

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print(24 + 24)
print(24-24)
print(24*24)
print("24 divided by 2 is", 24/2)
#  Step 4: User Input Practic
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers

input("What is your name ")

print("Your name is: ", (input))


# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
