# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Joaquin"
age = 17
favorite_color = "Purple"
favorite_number = 24

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print("Length of name:", len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My name is", (first_name), "and my favorite color is", (favorite_color))

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print(24 + 24)
print(24-24)
print(24*24)
print("24 divided by 2 is", 24/2)
#  Step 4: User Input Practic
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers

user_name=input("What is your name ")

print("Your name is:", user_name)


# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together

name = input("What's your name?")

fav_num = int(input("What's your favorite number: "))

fav_num2 = int(input("What's your second favorite number: "))

print("Your name is:", (name), "and the sum of your favorite numbers is", (fav_num)+(fav_num2))
